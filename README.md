## ***Task 1***
- ***Objective : Exploring and Visualizing a Simple Dataset***\
- ***Dataset : Use Iris dataset from seaborn***
- ***Model : No Model is used (Just explore and visualize the dataset)***
### - ***Results :***
- ***It has `150` rows and `5` coluumns***
- ***No Null values***
- ***It has three species , 'setosa','virginica','Virginica'***
- ***The relationship between `sepal length `and `sepal width`, with different colors representing the three `species` of iris flowers.***
- ***`Setosa` (Blue dots): This species tends to have smaller `sepal length` and larger `sepal width` compared to the other two species. They form a distinct cluster at the bottom-left of the plot.***
- ***`Versicolor` (Orange dots): This species generally falls in the middle range for both `sepal length` and `sepal width`, showing some overlap with both Setosa and Virginica.***
- ***`Virginica` (Green dots): This species typically has larger `sepal length` and a wider range of `sepal width`, often clustering towards the upper-right part of the plot.******
- ***The relationship between `petal length` and `petal width`, with different colors again representing the three `species` of iris flowers.***
- ***`Setosa` (Blue dots): This species is very clearly separated from the other two. They exhibit the smallest `petal length` and `petal width`, forming a tight, distinct cluster at the bottom-left of the plot.***
- ***`Versicolor` (Orange dots): This species generally falls in the middle range for both `petal length` and `petal width`. Its cluster is located between Setosa and Virginica, showing some overlap with Virginica but still largely distinct from Setosa.***
- ***`Virginica` (Green dots): This species typically has the largest `petal length` and `petal width`, clustering towards the upper-right part of the plot. There's some overlap with Versicolor, but Virginica generally occupies the region of longer and wider petals.***
